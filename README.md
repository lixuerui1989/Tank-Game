# Tank-Game
The player can control a hero blue tank by pressing the keyboard "W," "A," "S," and "D" to move in four directions and shooting the enemy by pressing "K" tanks. The enemy yellow tanks can run and shoot randomly. There are some wood and metal walls in the field, and the bullet can only destroy the wood walls.
